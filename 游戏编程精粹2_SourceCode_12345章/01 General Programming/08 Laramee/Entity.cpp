//
// MEDIA REGISTRY:
// In the article, I mention that the entity factory should
// know which media files have already been loaded so that
// new entities sharing them don't have to duplicate the data.
// My personal favorite way to do this is actually located in
// the level editor instead of the factory method: my tools
// put clones (i.e., entities with the same graphics and
// sounds) together in the level definition file, and the 
// loader checks to see if a new entity is a clone of the
// previous one or the first instance of a new "clone
// family"; if it is a first instance, the loader calls
// MakeNewEntity; if it is a clone, it calls Clone() on
// the family's first entity directly and does not involve
// the factory method.  
//
// Read the preceding paragraph a few times and it will
// eventually start to make sense. ;-)
