/*
This file contains classes that represent different colour spaces. Each
class is implemented as a template to allow it to be instantiated with
any type - typically unsigned char or double.

Each class should have conversion functions to convert to all of the
other colour spaces.

I don't use operators to do the conversions because automatic conversions
are frequently confusing, error prone, and they hide the performance costs -
without any clear benefit.

The implementation of the template classes is in the .cpp file and the
classes are explicitly instantiated for unsigned char and double. If you
wish to use them for other types you will need to add more explicit
instantiations. Keeping the implementation in the .cpp file is more
difficult for template classes, but it avoids having all clients see
all of the implementation code as well as iostreams and other headers.
