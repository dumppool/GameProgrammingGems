GLWEBCAM
--------
  This demo has just been tested with Windows.  You obviously need a webcamera
installed with the latest Video for Windows drivers for it to work.  Webcameras
tested are the Logitech and Creative Labs webcams.  Also you need a 3d accelerated
video card that has an OpenGL ICD (I doubt this will work with early voodoo's).
