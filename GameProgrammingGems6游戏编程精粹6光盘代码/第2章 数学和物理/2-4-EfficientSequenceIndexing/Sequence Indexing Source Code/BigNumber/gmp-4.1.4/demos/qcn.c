/* Usage: qcn <discriminant>...

   A fundamental discriminant means one of the form D or 4*D with D
   square-free.  Each argument is checked to see it's congruent to 0 or 1
   mod 4 (as all discriminants must be), and that it's negative, but there's
   no check on D being square-free.

   This program is a bit of a toy, there are better methods for calculating
   the class number and class group structure.
