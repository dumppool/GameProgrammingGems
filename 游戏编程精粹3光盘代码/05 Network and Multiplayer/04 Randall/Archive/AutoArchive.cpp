	Autoarchive's list of values to be packed and unpacked 
	automatically. The AutoArchive will handle correct packing
	and unpacking order as long as the variables are added in
	order. Typically, these variables are added during construction
	of some AutoArchive derived class. 

	Once a variable has been added, it cannot be removed.
