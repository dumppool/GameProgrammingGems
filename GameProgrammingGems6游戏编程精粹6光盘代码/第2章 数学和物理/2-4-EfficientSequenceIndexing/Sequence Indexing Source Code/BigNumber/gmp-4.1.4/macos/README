This is an unsupported port of GMP to Power Macintosh and MacOS. This
port is *not* for OS X which is a Unix derivative, that system can use
the normal configure and make described in the GMP manual.

This port will use the optimized 'mpn' assembler routines written for
32 bit PowerPC to gain speed. The BSD MP compatible library is not
built. The MacOS configuration uses the 'malloc-notreentrant' option
to optimize for speed.

The output is a library

        $GMP_SOURCE_DIR/macos/libgmp.$GMP_VERSION

Not all tests pass

        We never run the 'io' test the source don't compile

        If using Apple's compilers we never run the mpz t-mul, mpf t-add
        and mpf t-sub because they don't compile with MrC 4.1



REQUIREMENTS
============

To compile into the library you need

        Apple MPW (free)
	MacPerl 5 for MPW

GMP build was tested with MPW Shell 3.5.

MacPerl is free, download and install the MPW tool version from
any CPAN mirror. There is a list of mirrors at

    http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html
    http://mirror.cpan.org/

There is also a special site dedicated to MacPerl

    http://www.macperl.com

You need the "Appl" and "Tool" archive, for example

    http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/ports/mac/Mac_Perl_520r4_appl.bin
    http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/ports/mac/Mac_Perl_520r4_tool.bin



APPLE MPW INSTALLATION
======================

The MPW development system can be downloaded from

    http://developer.apple.com/tools/mpw-tools/

You need "StuffIt Expander" to unpack the source. You can download
"StuffIt Expander" for free from

    http://www.aladdinsys.com/expander/expander_mac_login.html

This result is a PDF file that can be read with the free Acrobat Reader

    http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html

From the MPW development environment you need at least

    ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Tool_Chest/Core_Mac_OS_Tools/MPW_etc./About_MPW_etc.sit.hqx
    ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Tool_Chest/Core_Mac_OS_Tools/MPW_etc./MPW-GM/MPW/MPW_Shell.sit.hqx
    ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Tool_Chest/Core_Mac_OS_Tools/MPW_etc./MPW-GM/MPW/Scripts.sit.hqx
    ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Tool_Chest/Core_Mac_OS_Tools/MPW_etc./MPW-GM/MPW/Tools/GetFileName.sit.hqx    
    ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Tool_Chest/Core_Mac_OS_Tools/MPW_etc./MPW-GM/MPW/Tools/Make.sit.hqx
    ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Tool_Chest/Core_Mac_OS_Tools/MPW_etc./MPW-GM/MPW/Tools/MrC.sit.hqx
    ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Tool_Chest/Core_Mac_OS_Tools/MPW_etc./MPW-GM/MPW/Tools/PPCAsm.sit.hqx
    ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Tool_Chest/Core_Mac_OS_Tools/MPW_etc./MPW-GM/MPW/Tools/PPCLink.sit.hqx
    ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Tool_Chest/Core_Mac_OS_Tools/MPW_etc./MPW-GM/Interfaces&Libraries/Libraries.sit.hqx
    ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Tool_Chest/Core_Mac_OS_Tools/MPW_etc./MPW-GM/Interfaces&Libraries/RuntimeLibraries.sit.hqx
    ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Tool_Chest/Core_Mac_OS_Tools/MPW_etc./MPW-GM/Interfaces&Libraries/Interfaces/CIncludes.sit.hqx
    
Put these into a folder and drag the whole folder to the "StuffIt
Expander" icon to unpack them.

Move "Scripts" folder down into the "MPW_Shell Folder".

Create a folder "Tools" inside the "MPW_Shell Folder" and move "Make",
"PPCAsm", "MrC", "PPCLink" and "GetFileName" down into the "Tools"
folder.

Create a folder "Interfaces&Libraries" at the same level as the
"MPW_Shell Folder". Put Put "RuntimeLibraries", "Libraries" into the
"Interfaces&Libraries" folder. Inside the "Interfaces&Libraries"
folder create a new folder "Interfaces" and put "CInlcudes" into it.

In summary, the manually moved files/folders should be located at

	:MPW_Shell Folder:Tools:Make
	:MPW_Shell Folder:Tools:PPCAsm
	:MPW_Shell Folder:Tools:MrC
	:MPW_Shell Folder:Tools:PPCLink
	:MPW_Shell Folder:Tools:GetFileName
	:Interfaces&Libraries:RuntimeLibraries:
	:Interfaces&Libraries:Libraries:
	:Interfaces&Libraries:Interfaces:CInlcudes:

Follow the rest of the installation instructions in "About MPW etc.".



MACPERL MPW INSTALLATION
========================

Drag these archives to the "StuffIt Expander" icon to unpack them.
The result is two installation programs. Run the "Mac_Perl_520r4_appl"
installer and let it install Perl into the default location, then run
the "Mac_Perl_520r4_tool" insaller.

To enable MPW to use MacPerl follow the instructions in the first
comment in the file "Install.MPW_Perl". For MacPerl 520r4 this is

  - Double click on the "MPW Shell" icon to start MPW and change the
    directory to the "MacPerl f" folder using the directory command or
    the "Set Directory..." menu item.

  - Execute the "Install.MPW_Perl" command, i.e. write the name of the
    command at the end of the "Worksheet" window, select the command
    text and hit the "Enter" key". This will create a configuration
    file and open it.

  - Execute the "Install.MPW_Perl" command again.

  - Execute the text the script wrote to the "Worksheet" window, i.e.
    drag select all the lines and hit the "Enter" key.

  - You need to restart MPW to make Perl work.



BUILD PROCESS
=============

The "macos" folder/directory should be inside the top directory in the
GMP source tree and should contain four files

        README          This file.
        configure       Create files and directories needed.
        unix2mac        Used to convert "configure" end-of-line chars.
        Makefile.in     Source for the final "Makefile".

Double click on the "MPW Shell" icon and set the directory using the
"Directory" menu to the "$GMP_SOURCE_DIR:macos:" folder/directory.

You run "configure" in a two step process

        % perl unix2mac configure > configure.mac
        % perl configure.mac

Then run "Make"

        % make

This will not execute the commands. It is like "make -n" on Unix, it
will display the commands to execute. You select the commands and
hit "enter" to actually execute the commands.

To test the code you execute the output from

        % make check

If there is an error the test program will complain. Note that the
test programs can contain errors so a test failure doesn't always
mean that the library is broken.

To cleanup to the state before configure you execute the output from

        % make clean

To remove the the resulting library as well you do

        % make distclean



PROBLEMS
========

Bug reports can be sent to bug-gmp@gnu.org.  Unfortunately the
developers don't use this port and can offer only very general help.
Reports including any fixes or updates necessary would be welcomed.

There may be problems if the program you use for unpacking the source
use automatic conversion of end-of-line characters.

This port may be out of sync with minor GMP releases or patches.
The MacOS build is very different from the Unix build process and
for some changes in the Unix build the build process for MacOS has
to be changed manually.

The library uses stream I/O operations for some of the GMP functions
and maybe for some error messages. This means that to link this
library to form a normal Mac application you may get link problems,
i.e. a Mac normally has no console/shell to write to.

If you are unfamiliar with MPW note that the "return" key and the
"enter" key mean different things to MPW.  The first just add a line
break, the second send the line your pointer is at or the selection
you have to the MPW command interpreter.

If you mount the GMP source from a Unix netatalk server don't move or
remove files from the Unix side while MPW is running. MPW cache
information about what the file system looks like and gets very
confused or crash.
