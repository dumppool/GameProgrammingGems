// WARNING: For mysterious reasons that I don't entirely understand, if you try to
// start the micro-threads you can run into troubles on NT when not running
// under a debugger. As soon as you call OutputDebugString with ESP set to a
// non-standard location - BOOM! Your application exits. Luckily it works fine
// under a debugger, so the trick is to not call OutputDebugString when not running
// under the debugger. I automatically detect this (if you use dprintf) so this works
// quite well. The only reason you might need to call OutputDebugString when not
// under the debugger is to send text to DBWin32, which traps OutputDebugString on
// NT, so I made dprintf() talk directly to DBWin32.
//
// So, be sure not to use OutputDebugString - use dprintf instead. That's not so
// bad - dprintf is more powerful and more portable.
