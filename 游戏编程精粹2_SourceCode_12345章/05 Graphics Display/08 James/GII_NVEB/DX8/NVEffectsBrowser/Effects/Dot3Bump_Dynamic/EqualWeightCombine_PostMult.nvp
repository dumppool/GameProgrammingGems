Comments:

Simple pixel shader that samples all 4 texture stages, averages these
samples and outputs the result.  Offset each texture stage's iterated
coordinates by various amounts to sample a texels neighbors & blur.

; and average them according to weights in constant mem:
; r0 = fac * t0 + fac * t1 + fac * t2 + fac * t3
; We could to this:
// mul r0, c[PCN_MULTFACTOR], t0
// mad r1, c[PCN_MULTFACTOR], t1, r0
// mad r0, c[PCN_MULTFACTOR], t2, r1
// mad r0, c[PCN_MULTFACTOR], t3, r0
; But that would loose low bits of precision, so instead
;  we bias to 9 bit signed components and operate on those,
;  shifting the end result back to the [0,1] unsigned range
