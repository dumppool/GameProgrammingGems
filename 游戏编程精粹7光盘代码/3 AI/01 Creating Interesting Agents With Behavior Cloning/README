1. Installation

To compile and install on Linux or Unix, see INSTALL.

To compile for Windows in Microsoft Visual C++ 2005, open VC8.sln in the Visual
C++ IDE and build.


2. Running the Demo

Simply run:

aishooter [-s] <script>

Where <script> is the filename of the agent script you wish to try out. There 
is an optional argument to the demo, -s which will prevent the demo from 
randomizing the ship's starting positions (useful for training new agents).


3. Existing Agent scripts

I have created a few agent scripts you can play with or use to train agents.
All of these scripts are written using the Lua language (http://www.lua.org)

For each agent I trained, I used "agent_null.lua", the -s option in the demo
program, as well as the default settings for the learning tool.

agent_null.lua  - An agent that does nothing
agent.lua       - A hand coded agent that seeks the player and shoots
agent_loop.lua  - Trained by circling the opponent ship
agent_kill.lua  - Trained by approaching the opponent and immediately firing


4. Training New Agents

NOTE: This code can be really slow if compiled in debug mode. Compile with
optimizations on (release mode) for faster training times.

Every time you run the demo, it creates a training data file upon exit. This
file can be passed into the learning tool to create a new agent script.

To run the learning tool:

learn <data_file> <output_script>

Simply pass in any data file you wish, and the desired output script and a new
agent will be created. You can directly try those scripts out in the demo game.

If you want to see other options, execute "learn" without any arguments.
