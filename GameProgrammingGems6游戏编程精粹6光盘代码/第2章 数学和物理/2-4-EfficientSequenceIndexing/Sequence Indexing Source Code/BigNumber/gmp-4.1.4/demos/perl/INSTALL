                  GMP PERL MODULE INSTALLATION


This module can be compiled within the GMP source directory or moved
elsewhere and compiled.  An installed GMP can be used, or a specified
GMP build tree.  Both static and shared GMP builds will work.

The simplest case is when GMP has been installed to a standard system
location

	perl Makefile.PL
	make

If not yet installed then the top-level GMP build directory must be
specified

	perl Makefile.PL GMP_BUILDDIR=/my/gmp/build
	make

In any case, with the module built, the sample program provided can be
run

	perl -Iblib/arch sample.pl

If you built a shared version of libgmp but haven't yet installed it,
then it might be necessary to add a run-time path to it.  For example

	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/my/gmp/build/.libs perl -Iblib/arch sample.pl

Documentation is provided in pod format in GMP.pm, and will have been
"man"-ified in the module build

	man -l blib/man3/GMP.3pm
or
	man -M`pwd`/blib GMP

A test script is provided, running a large number of more or less
trivial checks

	make test

The module and its documentation can be installed in the usual way

	make install

This will be into /usr/local or wherever the perl Config module
directs, but that can be controlled back at the Makefile.PL stage with
the usual ExtUtils::MakeMaker options.

Once installed, programs using the GMP module become simply

	perl sample.pl

And the documentation read directly too

	man GMP
