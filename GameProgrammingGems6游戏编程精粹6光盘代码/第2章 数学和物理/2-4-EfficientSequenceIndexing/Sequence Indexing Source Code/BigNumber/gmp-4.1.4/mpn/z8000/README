                      Z8000 MPN SUBROUTINES


This directory contains mpn functions for the Zilog Z8000.


STATUS

This code here is old and has not been used for a long time.

mpn/z8000 uses a 16-bit limb, it's possible this doesn't really work, on
account of various bits of C code assuming limb>=long and of course long is
invariably at least 32 bits.

mpn/z8000x uses a 32-bit limb, this could perhaps be an ABI choice.
Currently it's reached only by an MPN_PATH override.
