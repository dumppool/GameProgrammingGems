HTML help

If popup context help does not work in the various
Player3D dialogs then HTML help must be installed
on your PC.  Simply run hhupd.exe (in the \misc
directory) to install the HTML help control version
1.21.  You must have Internet Explorer 3.02 or later
installed in addition to running this update for HTML
help to work.

If you are running Windows 98 or Internet Explorer 4.0
or later then you should already have HTML help installed.
It is still worth running the update to make sure that you
have the latest version of the HTML help control.
