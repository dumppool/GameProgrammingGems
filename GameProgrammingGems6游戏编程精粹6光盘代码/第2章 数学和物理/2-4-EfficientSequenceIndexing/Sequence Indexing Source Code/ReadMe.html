		<H1 align="center"><FONT color="green">Benefits of Sequence Indexing</FONT></H1>
		<P>The concept of Sequence Indexing offers various new opportunities to refine our 
			existing solutions. For example, consider the following.</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
				<P align="justify"><STRONG>Range Sequences</STRONG> are quite useful in indexing a <EM>set 
						of variables with well-known ranges</EM> such as class objects, graph 
					statistics etc...
				</P>
				<p align="justify">For example, consider a pseudo class that defines a RPG 
					character details as below.</p>
				<pre>
class
{
	int Magic;	//possible values between [0..10];
	int Dexterity;	//possible values between [0..5];
	int Sight;	//possible values between [0..15];
	int Sex;	//suitable values [0,1];
};
					</pre>
				<P align="justify">Now, the objects of this class can be treated as taking one of 
					the all possible values for each variable. So, all objects of this class would 
					form a Range Sequence, and hence each object can be given an unique index. 
					Once, we have an index for any class object, the possibilites are endless.
				</P>
				<OL>
			<LI>
			We can use it as a hashing index to find/eliminate duplicates and to store 
			unique objects;
			<LI>
				<DIV align="justify">Can use it to communicate the state of the object across 
					network (without further requiring any special bitpacking algorithms);
				</DIV>
			<LI>
			Can use it to serialize the objects (for example, to quick save the state of 
			the game);
			<LI>
				<DIV align="justify">Further, it can be used to perform complex functions directly 
					on the objects instead of their variables. For example, to compare two persons 
					of the above mentioned class, we usually compare the individual member 
					vairables of the class. The other possibility is to use the object indices as a 
					map into a cumulative strength table and then use the table directly to compare 
					and contrast the objects. This grately helps in isolating the data from game 
					concepts --- an invaluable property of every well developed game;</DIV>
			</LI>
			</OL>
			<p>
			</p>
			<LI>
				<DIV align="justify"><STRONG>Combinational Sequences</STRONG> are quite useful in 
					all places wherever there is a notion of <EM>choice</EM>. For example, consider 
					a RTS game with a choice of nations or civilizations --- choosing 5 opponents 
					randomly out of 8 civilizations. In such cases there exists no known efficient 
					method that guarantess the choice to be unique from all past instances of the 
					game. Please note that while the seeded-random-generators guarantee that the 
					same sequence would be generated everytime the seed is same, no such guaratee 
					is provided for the contrary case --- that is, one can not be guaranteed that 
					the random sequences <EM>would not be repeated</EM> when we <EM>do not want them to 
						be repeated</EM>; This is due to the lack of a pure random number 
					generator.</DIV>
				<p align="justify">In such cases, Combinational Sequences offer a bounded guarantee 
					that no sequence it generates upto a bounded number of instances would be a 
					duplicate of any other instance. Hence all the user actions and choices made 
					during the game play can be indexed uniquely to express the game state in terms 
					of the Combination Sequence indices. Once we get the index of any game state, 
					the possibilites, as usual, are endless --- such as using it to communicate 
					across the servers in multi-player games, quick-saves etc...
				</p>
			<LI>
				<P align="justify">Finally, <STRONG>Permutation Sequences</STRONG> are useful 
					wherever there is <EM>exhaustive rearrangements of any given set of symbols</EM>. 
					The applications of Permutation Sequence are as exhaustive as the nature of its 
					sequences, ranging from Artificial Intelligence to Script Debugging to ... 
					these can be practically used anywhere where there is a scope for <EM>graph 
						explorations</EM>.
				</P>
				<p align="justify">
					For example, consider the problem of Path-Finding, where we examine a graph for 
					an optimal distance value using some graph-walking techniques such A* etc.... 
					However, a practical problem with these techniques in a real-time game 
					application is that these are highly non-preemptive. That is, their computation <EM>
						can not be spread across frames</EM> and one has to resort to alternative 
					techniques such as dedicate AI Thread etc... to avoid frame jittering. In other 
					words, these techniques can not be interleaved properly (in terms of 
					computation requirements) with other elements of the game such as graphics, 
					physics etc...
				</p>
				<P align="justify">Now, Permutaion Sequences provide an entire new opprotunities in 
					such cases. These Sequences can help making the above mentioned techniques 
					preemptive by allowing us to encode the processed graph state in terms of 
					Permutaion Sequence indices there by enabling us to pause-resume the 
					computation across multiple frames (by suitably updating the index as computed 
					path states are change). <EM>However, </EM>I must confess that at this point of 
					time this is more easily said than done --- nonetheless I hope we can give our 
					future generations a chance in this regard.
				</P>
			<LI>
				<P align="justify">Coming to the pseudo seeded random generator, here perhaps I 
					cannot convince how Combinational/Permutational Sequences are better than the 
					pseudo-random algorithm mechanism --- because, seeded random generation is also 
					one of the variants of Sequence Indexing (the seed being the index of the 
					generated random sequence), albeit of slightly different nature (the difference 
					being of no importance to our present discussion). Hence pseudo seeded random 
					generator can be used in <EM>almost</EM> all places where the 
					Combinational/Permutational Sequences might be useful (perhaps with a little 
					bit of adjustments here and there). And perhaps that might be one of the 
					reasons why no one yet felt the necessity of the other forms of indexing.</P>
				<p align="justify">In such cases, our interest in studying these other forms of 
					Sequences purely lies in their theoritical role they would play in allowing a 
					developer to choose from multitute of options that would closely and natively 
					resemble his requirements than forcing him to mend his problem to make it 
					suitable for few existing ones. While the benefits of these other forms of 
					Sequences is not lively clear today as such, I hope they would nonetheless 
					contribute their part in extending and perfecting our understanding of game 
					development in more liberal ways than would be possible without them.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					In this respect, while Sequence Indexing does not give us any thing new, it 
					helps us do our old things in a more elegant and efficient way.</p>
