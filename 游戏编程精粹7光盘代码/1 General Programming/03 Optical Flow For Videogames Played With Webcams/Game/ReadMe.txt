Hi,

To compile the game the following libraries will be required:

 - OpenCV: http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/
 - Microsoft DirectX SDK: http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/sdk/

Also the location of the "include" and "lib" directories of these libraries must be specified in the project. 
And remember adding the Working Directory "./executable" in Configuration Properties->Debugging.
