 WEBCAM INTERFACE
------------------

Source code for the article "Computer Vision in Games using the OpenCV library".

The object-oriented implementation and the Hue-Saturation variation can be found in the directory webcamInterface with a configured Visual C++ 7.0 project, and the binary files of the two variations of the algorithm ready to test.

The file CodeFromBook.cpp is the code from the article all together.

Note that you must have a compatible webcam properly installed for the sample application to work.
