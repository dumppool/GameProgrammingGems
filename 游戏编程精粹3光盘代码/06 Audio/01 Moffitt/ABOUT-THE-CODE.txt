ABOUT THE OGG VORBIS CODE
-------------------------

To help get you started programming with Ogg Vorbis the following files
have been provided.

For more information (and for more vorbis related code) please visit
the Ogg Vorbis site at http://www.vorbis.com.


vorbis-sdk-1.0rc3.zip
---------------------

This is the Windows SDK.  Libraries (debug and release) are provided, along
with headers and documentation.  Several example programs are in the
'examples' subdirectory, including basic decode, encode, and chaining.
Binary executables of the examples are also provided in the 'bin' 
subdirectory.


libogg-1.0rc3.zip
--------------------

This is the full C source code to the Ogg library, a part of the Ogg
Vorbis codec.  It includes project files for MSVC 6 (in the win32 directory), 
and build scripts for Unix based systems.  


libvorbis-1.0rc3.zip
--------------------

This is the full C source code to the Vorbis library, which depends on
the Ogg library.  This provides all the core decode functions, as well
as two helper libraries (vorbisfile and vorbisenc).  vorbisfile is an
easy to use decode library (see examples/vorbisfile_example.c) and vorbisenc
is used to set up encode runs (see examples/encoder_example.c).  This
contains MSVC 6 project files (in the win32 directory) as well as
Unix build scripts.
