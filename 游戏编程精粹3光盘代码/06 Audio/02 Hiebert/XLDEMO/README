XLDemo
======

Intro -

XLDemo is a demo program which shows how OpenAL and OpenGL can be used
together to create a cross-platform 3D audio/video application.

Running -

After compiling XLDemo it may be necessary to copy all the resource files
(.mdl, .wav, and .pcm) from the COMMON directory to the execution directory.
The main executable should then run without error.  You can control the
viewer with the arrow keys, step sideways with 'z' and 'x', and exit by
pressing 'ESC'.

Implementation -

Most of the code for XLDemo is in the /COMMON directory.  There are
OS-specific directories which contain the project files and a main program
for each platform supported.

There is a generic "Environment" object created in the main program which
updates the display and audio environments as the program runs.  The main
program continuously updates the Environment object with the current
position of the "viewer," who is the "person" walking around the virtual
world.  As the program has the opportunity, it tells the environment to
update the position of objects as well as the display and audio environment.

In the source code you will notice that the OpenGL and OpenAL updates are
done together using the same type of mechanisms.
