The demo shows an agent that patrols the world, gathering items and returning them to base.

Items are generated by pressing 'i'. Plan merging can be turned on or off by pressing 'p'.

The demo uses OpenGL and Glut, for which I've included the libraries. The demo uses GLFont for text drawing, which was written by Brad Fish (bhf5@email.byu.edu).
