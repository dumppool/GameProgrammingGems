To install CppUnit:
-------------------
1. Unzip "cppunit-1.10.zip".
2. Follow the instructions in the "cppunit-1.10.2.zip" folder for your platform, either Install-Win32.txt for Windows or Install-unix for the various unices.  These instructions will also explain how to configure CppUnit with your compiler.


To view the example project:
----------------------------
1. Open UnitTesting.sln from the "Visual Studio 7.1 Example" folder.

If you are on a different platform, the files of interest can still be viewed as such:

UnitTesting.cpp: the main example file that shows how to create the test fixtures and cases shown in the article and how to run them.

stdafx.h: shows the header files that you should include with a project using CppUnit.

allocator.h and model.h: the (poorly written) classes being tested by this project.
