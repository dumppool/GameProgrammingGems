Emitter Demo
(C) 2005 Sami Hamlaoui


This is a small demo showing off the 5 emitters covered in "Using 3D Surfaces as Audio Emitters" in Game Programming Gems 5. Yes, the sound effects are rubbish. That's because I'm a programmer, not an audio... er, guy.

Use WASD to move around, and hold down the left mouse button to look. The code is completely free for use in commercial and non-commercial projects with no licence attached (apart from the obligatory "don't blame me when it reformats your hard drive" one).

The Effects:

Sphere:		Flies
Point:		Shotgun
Line Segment:	Fluoro tube humming
Box:		Rain
Infinite Line:	Electricity wires
