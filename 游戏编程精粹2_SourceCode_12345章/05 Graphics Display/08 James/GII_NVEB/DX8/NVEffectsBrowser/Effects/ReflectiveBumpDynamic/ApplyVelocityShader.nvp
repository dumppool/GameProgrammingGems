Comments:

This shader samples t1, biases its value to a signed number, and applies this
value multiplied by a scale factor to the t0 sample.

This is used to apply a "velocity" texture value to a "height" state texture
for nearest-neighbor height-based water simulations.  The output pixel is
the new "height" value to replace the t0 sample in rendering to a new 
texture which will replace the texture selected into t0.

A nearlty identical shader using a different scaling constant is used to
apply the "force" value to the "velocity" texture at each texel.

t1 comes in the range [0,1] but needs to hold signed values, so a value of
0.5 in t1 represents zero velocity.  This is biased to a signed value in 
computing the new position.
