/********************************************************************
 *
 * CLASS SAMMY
 *
 * This is the main controller object for an entity's routine FSM 
 * operations.  As is, it only handles graphics and sound in a very
 * abstract manner, telling you for example that Sound Effect #3 should
 * be played, or that the entity is currently showing Animation Frame #45
 * taken from such-and-such an animation sequence.  You will need to add
 * your own models and WAV's for it to be useful.
 *
 * Two possible ways to do it:
 * - Use SAMMY as is, i.e., as an abstract controller.  
 *   Do this by adding a SAMMY object to the definition of your Entity
 *   superclass.  An entity would then query SAMMY for information,
 *   look up its own media files and provide the appropriate data to
 *   the renderer or to DirectSound.
 * - Extend SAMMY to own the media files itself.
 *
 * I suggest you pick the first option, which allows you to have 
 * multiple pointers to a single SAMMY object assigned to a bunch of
 * entities which look different (i.e., have different media files)
 * but act the same.  Plus, it's more object-oriented this way.  But
 * it's largely a matter of taste.
 *
 * Note that this version of SAMMY was designed for 2D sprites, and
 * may require substantial work before it can be adapted to 3D objects,
 * depending on your exact data structures.
