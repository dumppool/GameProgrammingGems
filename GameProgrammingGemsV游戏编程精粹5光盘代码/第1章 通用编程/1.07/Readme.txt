This is program has been developed to demonstrate how easy is to use the Generic Pager, described 
in Game Programming Gems 5. In this test we paging a image file, loading and unloading
different parts of it and using these parts as textures ( which are also created and destroyed). 
All of this is done with the Generic Pager and a Simple Engine (GPG5 Test Engine) designed and 
implemented for this purpose. The Generic Pager runs without any problem in its own thread.
