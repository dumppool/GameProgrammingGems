
Source compilation description:

The following code is compiled under Mircosoft Visual C++ 6.0
with Servicepack 3 and up. In addition it uses Dinkumware's fixes for 
the VC++ STL implementation. In case you for some reason shouldn't have
these installed already, you can download them from 
http://www.dinkumware.com/vc_fixes.html

Replace the files directly, or save them to a directory and place
the include path before the std lib include path in
\tools\option\include files in Visual Studio.
