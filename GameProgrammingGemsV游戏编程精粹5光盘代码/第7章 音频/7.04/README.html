<h3>
synopsis
</h3>

<p>
This program lets you play with various parameters of a 4-channel FDN 
in real time. A graph shows the theoretical transfer function 
of the FDN as a whole.
</p>

<h3>
usage
</h3>

<p>
Click on the ellipsis "..." next to the "input file" field and select a
wave file in ".wav" pcm format or a file containing raw pcm data. The play button starts the action.
The graph will start to animate if the delay lengths are modulated.
</p>

<p>
The task manager will show some ~10% CPU usage during playback. This is due to drawing
the graph with windows GDI, it's not the cause of the reverb procedure. When you minimize the window, CPU usage
should drop to below measureable.
</p>

<p>
Playback frequency and volume can be changed during playback.
</p>

<p>
If you press ENTER inside an editbox, the program will close. Press TAB instead.
</p>

<h3>
output
</h3>

<p>
The live sound output is also recorded to disk as a file named <code>record.wav</code> into the current directory,
if such a file can be opened (may be locked by CoolEdit, for instance). Usually the current directory is
set to the directory from where you opened the input file.
</p>


<h3>
presets
</h3>

Presets are contained in a .txt file with the name "presets.txt" which is parsed
when the program starts. You can edit this file, see there for explanation.

<ul>
<li>"Temple of the ancestors" - Very long reverberation time, large room.
<li>"Temple of the ancestors (back door)" - Same as above but with 100% occlusion of direct sound.
<li>"Open Stage in the Woods" - Very large, echoey room.
<li>"Cardio Fitness at the Gym" - Medium size room, bright spectrum.
<li>"U-Boat Club Party" - Small room, strong coloration, high frequency damping
<li>"Christians Former very small Dorm Room" - very small room
<li>"Howling Spirits" - Short delay lines as oscillators, sweeping modulation gives pitch shift.
<li>"Leaking Biohazard Container" - Short delay lines as oscillators, inharmonic resonant modes.
<li>"Oversize Shoe Box" - Feedback matrix simulates sign change at open ended wave reflection, gives hollow sound.
</ul>

<h3>
parameters
</h3>

<p>
Changing any parameter will have an immediate effect.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
Feedback matrix<br>
Delay lengths<br>
Half lives
<dd>
These work as described in the article.
</dd>
<dt>
Input and output rotation
<dd>
The input and output matrices contain some sin/cos dependent on these parameters.
This serves to somehow distribute the signal from stereo to 4-channel and back to stereo.
</dd>
<dt>
Delay length modulation
<dd>
The delay lengths are modulated by a sinusoid of given period and depth. 
</dd>
<dt>
Mix
<dd>
Dry mix is the percentage of direct signal, wet mix is the percentage of reverberated signal
in the final result.	
</dd>
</dl>


<h3>
others
</h3>


<dl>
<dt>
Mute Input
<dd>
Pretend the input to the reverb was silence. Good for listening to reverb responses.
</dd>
<dt>
Bypass
<dd>
Listen to the original signal instead of the reverberated one. The reverb
keeps updating in the background.
</dd>
<dt>
Reset
<dd>
Zero all delay lines.
</dd>
