| CurveBall

|
| A simple demonstration of back of the envelope aerodynamics. This demo
| simulates the flight of a baseball, with spin that results in a lifting
| force that causes the ball to curve to the left or right.
|
| Keyboard controls:
|
|  'r' - restart the simulation, and put it in pause mode
|  'q' - quit the application
|  'a' - decrease the speed of the throw
|  's' - increase the speed of the throw
|  '+' - increase the rate of spin
|  '-' - decreate the rate of spin
|  'g' - start the simulation, or take it out of pause mode
|  'p' - pause the simulation
|  '>' - increase simulation speed
|  '<' - decrease simulation speed
|
| This demo is a companion to the chapter titled "Back of the
| Envelope Aerodynamics for Game Physics" in the book "Game
| Programming Gems 5" published by Charles River Media
