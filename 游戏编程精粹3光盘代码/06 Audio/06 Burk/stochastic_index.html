<p>This C++ software was written to accompany two chapters in the book
Game Gems III.
<h2>
Running the Demo</h2>
An executable file have been provided for computers running Windows.
<p>This demonstrate the use of stochastic (random) synthesis to generate
several complex sounds. To hear the demo, double click on <b>"StochasticDemo.exe"</b>.
<p>Hit the '?' key to see the menu. You can turn the various sounds on
and off. For the rain, you can increase the number of raindrops per second
by hitting 'R' and decrease the rate by hitting 'r'.
<h2>
Compiling the Demo</h2>
In the win32 folder, you will find a GameGems.dsw Visual C++ workspace.
Double click on that and then compile the project. The executable will
be placed in the win32 folder.
<p>These demos use the PortAudio library for audio I/O. This is a free
open-source cross platform audio API that runs on Windows, Macintosh and
Unix. You should be able to compile the software with little or no modification
for those platforms. I have provided source code for the Windows MME implementation.
For serious development, or to compile on non-windows platforms, you should
download the latest PortAudio source code from:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.portaudio.com/">http://www.portaudio.com/</a>
<p>The PortAudio web site has documentation and tutorials that explain
how to use it on diffeent platforms.
<h2>
Software Design</h2>
The software is based on a unit generator architecture. Each unit generator
creates or processes sound. The output of a unit can be pass to another
for processing. Complex circuits can be built from smaller units or circuits.
<p>The units and circuits have a gen() method that generates the outputs
samples using whatever function is specific to the unit. A Unit_Add, for
example, simply adds its inputs together to make an output.
<p>The audio synthesis is normally done in small blocks instead of one
sample at a time. The output samples are written to the outputs array.
This is more efficient for the CPU. Some units, however, create very slow
signals and only need to be generate one sample per block. They have a
gen1() method that only generates one sample and writes it to outputs[0].
<p>The calculations are done using 32 bit float data types defined as GGSynthFloat.
This is faster than doubles and is plenty accurate enough for game synthesis.
<p>Before using this software in a game, please check the web site for
bug fixes or updates:

<p>I hope you find this software useful in your projects.
