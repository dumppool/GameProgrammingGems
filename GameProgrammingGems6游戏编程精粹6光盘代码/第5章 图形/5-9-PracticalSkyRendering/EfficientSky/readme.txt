Title: Efficient Sky Demo

Created by: Aurelio Reis (AurelioReis@gmail.com) - www.CodeFortress.com

Version 1.0 (07/25/05):
Initial implementation.

Description:
This demo presents some of the key concepts discussed in the article
"Practical Sky Rendering for Games" in Game Gems 6.

For an up-to-date version of this demo please visit www.CodeFortress.com.

Features:
* Real-time dynamic sky calculated based on the current time of day.
* Sky Cube Rendering: cache the results of a sky render into a Cube Map.
* Per-pixel versus per-vertex sky implementation comparisions (for low, medium,
and high polygon sky dome representations).
* Normal Mapped Terrain.
* Sun Projection into the Sky.
* Volumetric Light Scattering (currently disabled).
* Star Field, pre-baked into a Cube Map and projected into the sky at night.
* Moon projection and moon light casting on the scene.

Wish List:
* Clouds, either through perlin noise or pre-generated scrolling fields.
* Projecting cloud image into the terrain for cloud shadows and/or using
high-resolution shadow maps for terrain shadows.
* Basic fog is in but getting scattering fog working again would be nice,
or perhaps another decent kind of aerial perspective technique.	
* Glare/Glow for the Sun and Moon through Post-Process Effects.

Fixmes:
* None.

Usage:
Use WASD to move and mouse button 1 to look around.

Requirements:
Win9x/WinNT/WinXP
D3D 9.0 compatible graphics card

Known Issues:
* Strange artifacts on Sky Cube in windowed mode.
* Seams on the low-res sky dome model's normal map.

Acknowledgments:
The algorithms presented here were inspired or based on a number of peoples work,
too many to list. Notable authors are Jensen, Preetham, and Nishita who have
contributed greatly to the study of dynamic skies in computer graphics.
