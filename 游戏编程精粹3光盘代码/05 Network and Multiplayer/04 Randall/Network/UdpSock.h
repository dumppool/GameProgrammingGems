/**
	@brief An IP datagram socket

	The UdpSock class implements asynchronous I/O. The interface is 
	platform independant. The underlying implementation exploits 
	platform-specific optimizations for efficient asynchronous I/O.

	To employ raw IP datagram sockets in an application, simply
	derive from this class, implement the onReceive() method, and
	periodically call update(). Sockets with data pending will
	invoke onReceive and provide the source address of the datagram
	and the payload in the Archive::Stream parameter.

	Reading is implicit on the socket. When update() is invoked, 
	the UdpSock will continue to enqueue receives until no more
	data is available on the socket. update() will return when
	all UdpSock objects have pumped their incoming data.
