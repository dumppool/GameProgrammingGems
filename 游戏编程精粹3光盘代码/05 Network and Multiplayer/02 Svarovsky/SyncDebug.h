// Extra work done by the CPU to aid out-of-sync error debugging.
// Litter random points in your code with calls to SYNC_MSG, SYNC_INT and so on.

// To do the debugging, #define _SYNCDEBUG in your project settings.
// Elsewhere in your game you should calculate a simple checksum (such as the
// sum of all object positions) and when this checksum is no longer the same on
// all computers, simply call SyncDebug::OutputToFile() on every machine.
// This will write a large report to disk, either to the root of T: (which
// has always been a shared network temporary drive where I have worked),
// or C: if that does not exist.

// This shared file will have the messages that you littered your code with, as
// if they had been printf's and the file was the stdout.

// If you have a T:\, you will notice how the report is called syncreport_machinename.txt.
// This is useful when you're playing with others round the office when testing the game;
// one person can collect all the syncreports for the game. Typically only one machine
// will differ from the others.

// Useful bit of the file.

// You can pass strings to SYNC_MSG, but they must be statically-declared strings,
// ie they stay in memory for the whole running of the game. This is because this
// module only saves the pointer to the strings, for speed's sake. You can also
// pass floats or integers.

#define SYNC_MSG(n)		 SyncDebug::Msg(n)

// SYNC_INT is good for most integer types; if you simply use SYNC_MSG the compiler
// will often complain about implicit type conversions. SYNC_INT just makes the
// type conversion explicit.

#define SYNC_INT(n)		 SyncDebug::Msg(int(n))

// This is a shorthand for SYNC_MSG("\n")

#define SYNC_CR()		 SyncDebug::NewLine()

// The new-gameturn message cannot be simply a SYNC_MSG because SyncDebug wants to
// know when gameturns happen, if it is asked to print out the report.
