Menuing System

This project provides a basic way of implementing a menuing system. The system allows
for dynamic menu creation and has the ability to be extended as a project grows.

To view the example project, open the menuSystem.sln file in Visual Studio .NET 2003. 

This project contains the main menuing system framework as well as three example test menus
and two example controls.
