
This is a Visual C++ 6.0 workspace. It contains a static library with 
a regular resource pointer (RefPtr) and a reference-counted one (RCRefPtr).
It also contains a project with unit tests for all the functionality of
the resource pointers. 

The test framework for the unit tests is based Michael Feather's 
CppUnitLite. Just build the project and the unit tests will be 
executed automatically as the last step of the build process. If
any of the tests fail, the build will fail and the failed tests will 
be shown in the output window.
