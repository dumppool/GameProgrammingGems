These suggestions are from Graham Rhodes (grhodes@nc.rr.com) for
compiling the code under Windows using gcc.  The default is that
everything is set to compile for Linux (Readhat 7.3, gcc 2.96, i686).


---------------------------------------------------------------


1) In the Makefile, on the LIBS line, replace "GL" with "opengl32" and
replace "glut" with "glut32"

2) make sure that you have a matched glut32.dll and libglut32.a
pair. To do this, download the prebuilt glut for Win32 from
http://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html. This install provides two
things, glut.def and glut32.dll, that can be used to make libglut32.a.
Next, use dlltool (part of the Cygwin install of gcc on Windows) to
create a matching libglut32.a as follows:

dlltool -d glut.def -D glut32.dll -l libglut32.a -k

Modify the Makefile to use the glut headers from the above download,
and to link to this newly built libglut32.a instead of the one that is
installed with Cygwin. The provided glut32.dll also should be in the
path when you run the simulate application.


3) You may also want to set CC = gcc-2 (this will use the 2.95.3
version of gcc, since gcc 3.x seems to give far more compile
errors/warnings than the 2.9x version. Gcc 2.95.3 must be installed
for this to work.)
