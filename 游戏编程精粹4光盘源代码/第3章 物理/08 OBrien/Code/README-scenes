In many of these scene (.setup) files the simulation will run slower
when collisions are occuring.  A less picky collision method would be
probably substantially faster.  The second number in each file
determines if contratins of penalty forces should be used for
collision responce.  ( 0 -- constraints, 1 -- penalty ) The penalty
method tends to be faster but looks worse.

The first number on the fifth line is the threshold used for
collisions detection.  Larger numbers give faster simulations, but at
the cost of less accurate collisions responce.
