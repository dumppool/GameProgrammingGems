        NameGen : Random Name Generation

             Developed for the book:
              Game Programming Gems
             Edited by Mark A. DeLoura

1 Purpose
The two source files show the basic algorithms for
building a letter frequency table, and then using
such a table to generate random words.

These files use the PRandGen code also included on
the CD, for generating random numbers.

Note that in order to use this source code, the
pseudorandomizer object should be created and
seeded as in the PRandGen code.
