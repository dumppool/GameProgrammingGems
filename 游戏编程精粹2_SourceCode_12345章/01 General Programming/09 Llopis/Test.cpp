// Simple test program to test the deprecation manager.
// Run the program and look at the debugger output.
// A few things to note:
// - FunctionA() is called many times, but only from
//   three separate places (so that's what will be reported).
// - FunctionC() is deprecated but it's never called, so it
//   won't be reported at all.
// - Commenting out all the calls to deprecated functions will
//   stop the deprecation manager from being created/destroyed
//   so there won't be any messages when the program exits.
