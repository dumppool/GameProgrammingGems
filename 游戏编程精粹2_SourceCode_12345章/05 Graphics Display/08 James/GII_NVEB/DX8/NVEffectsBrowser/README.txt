See the NVEffectsExplained.doc or .htm for an overview of each effect.

We are no longer providing source code for the NVEffectsBrowser.exe.  We provide a few headers and source modules for your reference, though you should not need them.  See the existing effects and code under "shared" for the Effects Browser API if developing your own effects.
