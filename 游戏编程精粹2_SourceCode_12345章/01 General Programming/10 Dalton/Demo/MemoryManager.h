 * Author: Peter Dalton

 *
 * Description:
			This Memory Manager software provides the following functionality:
			  1. Seamless interface.
			  2. Tracking all memory allocations and deallocations.
				3. Reporting memory leaks, unallocated memory.
				4. Reporting memory bounds violations.
				5. Reporting the percentage of allocated memory that is actually being used.
				6. Customizable tracking.

	    The code is self documented, thus reading through this header file should tell you
			everything that you would ever need to know inorder to use the memory manager.
