****
Bugs are marked !, things that should be done soon are marked +,
and longer-term ideas are marked -
+ see if inlining array functions speeds things up a bit
+ general code clean up and improve comments
- Add backface culling code to subdivision scheme
- Add visiblity culling code to subdivision scheme
- Modify interpolating schemes so that instead of copying even vertices mesh references vertices in a previous level
- Change GLScene so that is sorts materials to minimise changes and also imporve multi-pass rendering to allow for more diverse materials.
- make subdivision schemes more robust so that meshes that are continuous can be handled
