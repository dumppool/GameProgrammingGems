This directory contains preliminary assembly code for nails-enabled
21264.  The code is not very well optimized.

1. The *mul_* functions use too many registers.  Several temps could be
   combined.
2. The *mul_1 functions load from up and rp very early.  The code could be
   considerably simplified with later loads.
3. The addmul_1 and submul_1 functions run 1.25 cycles/limb slower than
   possible with better U0/U1/L0/L1 scheduling.
