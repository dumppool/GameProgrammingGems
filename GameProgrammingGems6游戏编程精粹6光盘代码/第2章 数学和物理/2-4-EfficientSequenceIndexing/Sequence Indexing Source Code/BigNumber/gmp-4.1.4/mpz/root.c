/* Naive implementation of nth root extraction.  It would probably be a
   better idea to use a division-free Newton iteration.  It is insane
   to use full precision from iteration 1.  The mpz_scan1 trick compensates
   to some extent.  It would be natural to avoid representing the low zero
   bits mpz_scan1 is counting, and at the same time call mpn directly.  */
