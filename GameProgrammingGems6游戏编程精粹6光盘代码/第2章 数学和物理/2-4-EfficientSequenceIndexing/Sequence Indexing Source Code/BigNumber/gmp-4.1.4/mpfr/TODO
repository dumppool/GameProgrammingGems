Documentation:

- add a description of the algorithms used + proof of correctness

Installation:

- from Kevin Ryde <user42@zip.com.au>:
   Determine the exp2/exp3 thresholds using tune/tuneup.c.

- problems when mpfr uses a different compiler (gcc) than gmp (for example
	cc under Solaris 2.7).

New functions to implement:

- those from LIA: missing secant, cosecant, cotangent (trigo/hyperbolic)
- nextafter/nextforward : X + epsilon if X < Y, X - epsilon if X > Y
- nextabove/nextbelow ?

Rounding:

Efficiency:

Miscellaneous:

- rename mpf2mpfr.h to gmp-mpf2mpfr.h?

- add mpfr_get_ld for 'long double' [asked by J-C Fauge`re] ?
  (exists since K&R, but has not necessarily a greater precision than double)
  cf http://anubis.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n869/

- from Kevin Ryde <user42@zip.com.au>:
   Also for pi.c, a pre-calculated compiled-in pi to a few thousand
   digits would be good value I think.  After all, say 10000 bits using
   1250 bytes would still be small compared to the code size!
   Store pi in round to zero mode (to recover other modes).

- problem when reading a float followed by a character, for example 1.5*x
	[from Fabrice.Rouillier@loria.fr, Mon, 04 Dec 2000]

- rewrite mpfr_get_str and mpfr_set_str to use mpn_get_str and mpn_set_str.
	(Torbjorn Granlund <tege@swox.com>, 30 Jan 2002)

- mpfr_pow isn't completely specified (concerning signed zeros).

- rename mpfr_isinteger to mpfr_integer_p.
	(Kevin Ryde, 05 Mar 2002)

- some comparison functions aren't completely specified (concerning NaN).
  Add new comparison functions (eq, ne, lt, gt, le, ge)?
