<h2>
Creating a Compelling 3D Audio Environment
</h2>
The sample code demonstrating the tips for the article <i>Creating a
Compelling 3D Audio Environment</i> is in the OpenAL demo program XLDemo.
If you look at the source code for XLDemo, you will find that the audio
engine is in the file audioenv.cpp.<br>
<br>
Here are the contents of this directory:<br>
<br>
Windows -- OpenALwEAX.exe will install OpenAL on your system if you do not
have it already.  OpenALSDK.exe will install an entire OpenAL SDK, including
XLDemo in both binary and source code form.<br>
<br>
MacOS -- "OpenAL Installer" will install OpenAL on your system if you do not
have it already (for either MacOS 9 or OS X).  "OpenAL SDK Installer" will
install documentation and source code, including XLDemo.  XLDemo itself will
only run under OS 8 or 9.<br>
<br>
Linux -- "XLDemo.tar.gz" contains the source code for XLDemo for review
under Linux.  To compile this code, you will need to have OpenAL
installed.<br>
<br>
